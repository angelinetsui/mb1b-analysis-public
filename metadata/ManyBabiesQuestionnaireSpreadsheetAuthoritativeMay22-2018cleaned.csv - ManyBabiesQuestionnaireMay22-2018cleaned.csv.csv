Finally, the RA is given the opportunity to assist with parts of a real subject (e.g., starting up the eye tracking protocol with assistance) and to fully run a few pilot participants (normally, those who are either out of the targeted age range or who are preterm and thus could not be used in the final dataset).","As stated above, before running a 'real' participant the RA both partially-runs (assists) or fully runs pilot subjects with the PI in the room (or with the ability for the PI to watch video footage of the session with the RA afterwards).

In addition, because most studies we conduct in the lab involves music perception, we ask whether the baby has frequent ear infection, whether there is a history of hearing problems in the family, whether the baby is exposed to unusual noise and whether he or she has cold on the day of testing.

Because all ongoing studies in the lab require online coding, students go through a training and they have to become reliable in coding eye-gaze before starting testing infants.

Then, students and I first go through 1-2 experimental session videos from previous studies that were coded by me and I explain the technical details of the procedure. Then they have to code 3-4 videos that were previously coded. Some of these videos are more difficult to code than others (e.g., the infant is not very stable etc). Students' coding has to agree with at least 90% of the frames in all these videos. So far, I only had 2 graduate students who are involved in infant testing and both passed this training successfully. After this, students observe me while setting up and testing 3-4 babies. After this, they test at least 2-3 babies while I am present. If everything goes well, they start testing alone and they are assisted by an undergraduate RA.

1- What is your child's due date?  If they are over 4 weeks early, they are ineligible to participate.  We correct for gestational age if they are born before their due date. For example, if we have a study starting at 6 months and an infant is born 2 weeks early, their eligibility for the study would begin at 6 months, 2 weeks.    
2- Does your child hear any languages other than English?  If so, how many hours per week on average?  If a infant hears over 10 hours of another language per week they are not eligible for a monolingual study.  
3 - Does your child have any hearing or vision problems, corrected or uncorrected?  Children with hearing problems or tubes are ineligible, even if they are corrected.  
4- How many ear infections has your child had in the past 12 months?  If they have had over 4, they are ineligible for the study.

We always ask the following screening questions:
- Has your child had any ear infections in the last 12 months?
- How many days before or after their due date was your child born? 
- Does your child hear any languages besides English on a regular basis? If so, how many hours per week (of non-English language)? 
- Does your child have any hearing or vision concerns?

In our lab, our *typical* practice is to treat babies as ""practice"" participants (i.e. exclude them from our sample), if one of the following is true:
- They have had 4 or more ear infections in the last 12 months.
- They were born 28 days or more before their due date (36+ weeks gestational age)
- They have had 10 hours + per week of language exposure other than English.
- There are significant concerns regarding vision or hearing.

For the ManyBabies study, we will ask the same questions for our records, but we will follow the exclusionary criteria laid out in the manual:
- We will NOT exclude any participants based on ear infections.
- We will require 37 weeks (NOT 36 weeks) gestation.
- We will exclude participants based on the 90% language exposure criterion from the ManyBabies manual, as assessed by the ManyBabies ""Family Background Questionnaire"".","Toys/books,Cash,Other",,1 book (Option 1 - families choose ONE of three options).,$10.00 (Option 2 - families choose ONE of three options).,,Lab T-Shirt (Option 3 - families choose ONE of three options).,Any level (including undergraduates of any level) as long as they are appropriately trained,,,,"All training RA's meet with the lab manager to discuss the Head Turn Preference procedure.

5 preselected videos are then coded by the trainee as if they were watching them live. After each video, reliability of their coding responses is checked via comparison of overall left and right looking button press times to the coding key. RAs should achieve 95% agreement with the key. The training videos are subsequently discussed with an experienced Head Turn coder (typically the lab manager) to allow for questions and look at differences and identify any issues.

We also recruit families through word-of-mouth and through advertisements at the local Science Museum or those placed at community infant development events – in those cases, families would sign-up online or would phone the EDRG office or one of the six labs directly. Approximately 88% of recruitment is achieved through the hospital; the remaining sources make up 22%.","When a study is in need of participants, undergraduate Research Assistants (RAs) use the database to find and reach out to families with babies who meet the study requirements (e.g. using the DOB, gestation, language exposure, and diagnoses fields on the database).  RAs first call the parents; if they are unable to reach the parent by phone, they send an email.  RAs briefly remind the parent how they originally signed up for the database and what the Early Development Research Group is. They ask if the parent is interested in participating in a study and if so, they verify the infant’s date of birth and language exposure before booking the study. It is important to note that these studies are held at the university, which is at the edge of Vancouver, and so the potentially long travel distance may be a factor in determining which families agree to participate.

For ManyBabies we follow this standard model of data-acquisition at CDC. Most babies will be tested by MIkołaj Hernik (Associate Research Fellow with over 9 years of infancy research) assisted by an RA with over 3 years of experience in assisting with  (and occasionally running) infants studies at CDC, including working with the EyeLink eyetracker.

The procedure of ManyBabies was piloted with about 10 12-15-month-olds in order for both the researcher and the RA to get acquainted with procedure elements not common in our typical procedures (e.g. blinding mums with headphones) and to get a sense of older-babies behavior in the task.

When the researcher (MH) is not available for testing, some babies may be tested by the RA, who typically assists in the study, assisted by an RA in training.","See previous answer. Typically an RA is has already considerable experience running some infant paradigms. If the method is new, the study is often preceded by a small pilot which may last until the procedure goes smoothly.
