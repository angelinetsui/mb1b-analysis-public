# Intro

This is the second MB1 preprocessing script. The goal of this file is to ensure that all variables have the values assumed by further analysis. 

This script is organized around variable types being processed. 

**identifiers** 
[should not be modified after reading and merging in 01_read_and_merge.RMD]

* lab
* subid

**trial variables**

* trial_order
* trial_num
* stimulus
* trial_type
* stimulus_num

**moderators/exclusion variables**

* method
* age_days
* NAE
* monolingual
* gender
* trial error
* participant error
* preterm
* pilot

**DVs**

* looking_time
* total_trial_time

** Other variables for matching**

* macarthur ladder

NOTE: No exclusions are performed in this script. These are all performed in `03_exclusion.Rmd`.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("helper/common.R")
```

If column types aren't specified, read_csv makes guesses about them based on the first 1000 rows of data. Below, data are read in with column types specified for columns that will be used in this .Rmd file. `col_only` in the code means that all columns that aren't specified will be dropped. (see issue #66 for more info) For now, all columns are read in as either a double (using shortcut "d") or character ("c"). metadata/columns_used_in_02_variable_validation has information about the  type selected for each column and also indicates which columns are available but dropped.

```{r}
d <- read_csv("processed_data/01_merged_ouput.csv", col_types = cols_only(subid = "c", lab = "c", trial_type = "c", stimulus = "c", trial_num = "d", looking_time = "d", total_trial_time = "d", trial_error = "c", trial_error_type = "c", method = "c", age_days = "d", trial_order = "d", session_error = "c", session_error_type = "c", notes = "c", second_session = "c", lang_group = "c", lang1 = "c", lang1_exposure = "d", lang2 = "c", lang2_exposure = "d", lang3 = "c", lang3_exposure = "d", lang4 = "c", lang4_exposure = "d", macarthur_ladder = "d", parenta_gender = "c", parenta_education = "d", parentb_gender = "c", parentb_education = "d", preterm = "c", days_preterm = "d", hearing_vision = "c", hearing_vision_info = "c", cognitive_developmental = "c", cognitive_developmental_info = "c", gender = "c"))

```

Data import functions are factored into a helper functions file. 

```{r}
source("helper/preprocessing_helper.R")
```

# Trial variables

The goal of this subsection is to ensure that we have the following variables. 

* trial_order - which counterbalance? [1:4]
* trial_type - IDS vs. ADS 
* stimulus_num - which number in the pair [-1 or 1:8]
* trial_num - which number in -2, -1, 1:16

## trial_order

What trial orders do we have?

```{r}
unique(d$trial_order)

d %>% 
  filter(!trial_order %in% 1:4 | is.na(trial_order)) %>% 
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  filter(isFALSE(session_error)) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable
```

If we do not have trial order information, the best we can do is coerce to `NA`. 

```{r}
d$trial_order[!(d$trial_order %in% 1:4)] <- NA
```

We need to pass this test. 

```{r}
validate_that(all(d$trial_order %in% c(1,2,3,4) | is.na(d$trial_order)))
```

** `trial_order` checking is satisfactory **

## trial_type and stimulus_num

We need to set up the `trial_type`/`stimulus_num` fields for shuffling and computing differences. `trial_type` should be `IDS`/`ADS`. `stimulus_num` should be -1 for training, nad 1:8 otherwise.  

Note that `trial_type` and `stimulus` carry redundant information. We make use of this and infer trial_type from stimulus. 
```{r}
unique(d$stimulus)
```

Let's fix some of these to start. 

```{r}
d <- d %>%
  mutate(stimulus = toupper(stimulus),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "-",""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, " ",""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "FINAL",""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "NEW",""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "ASD","ADS"),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "TRIAL","TRAIN"),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "TRAINING","TRAIN"),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, ".WAV",""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "MBRETEST", ""),
         stimulus = str_replace(stimulus, "FADE", ""),
         stimulus = ifelse(str_detect(str_sub(stimulus,0,1), "[0-9]"),
                           str_c(str_sub(stimulus,2,4),str_sub(stimulus,0,1)), 
                           stimulus), # flip reversed ones
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "ERROR", NA, stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "NA", NA, stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "N/A", NA, stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "N", NA, stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "TRAIN" & trial_num %in% -2:2, "TRAIN", stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "TRAIN_TRAIN_MUSIC", "TRAIN", stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "TRAIN1", "TRAIN", stimulus),
         stimulus = ifelse(stimulus == "TRAIN2", "TRAIN", stimulus))
         
unique(d$stimulus)
```

Note that some labs marked IDS/ADS with no number. These need to be fixed by hand. 

```{r}
d %>%
  filter(stimulus %in% c("IDS", "ADS","NA") ) %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable
```

Also `NA`s need to be fixed. Right now we will assume these are all for error trials. 

```{r}
d %>%
  filter(is.na(stimulus)) %>%
  filter(isFALSE(session_error)) %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable
```

Now we separate this field to get `stimulus_num`.

```{r}
d <- d %>% 
  separate(stimulus, into = c("trial_type", "stimulus_num"), sep = 3) %>% #We override trial_type here and extract it from stimulus
  mutate(trial_type = ifelse(trial_type == "TRA", "TRAIN", trial_type), 
         stimulus_num = ifelse(stimulus_num == "IN", "-1", stimulus_num), 
         stimulus_num = as.numeric(stimulus_num))
```

Now ensure that this worked.

```{r}
validate_that(all(d$trial_type %in% c("TRAIN","IDS","ADS") | is.na(d$trial_type)))
validate_that(all(d$stimulus_num %in% c(-1,1:8) | is.na(d$stimulus_num)))
```

** `trial_type` and `stimulus_num` checking is satisfactory **

## trial_num

There are two issues here. 

First, labs used `trial_num` differently. A few numbered from 1:18.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = trial_num)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks=-3:20)
```

Let's find those labs and deal with the issue.

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  summarise(min = min(trial_num),
            max = max(trial_num)) %>%
  filter(min != -2 | max !=16) %>%
  datatable
```

We will deal with this by enumerating lab practices and fixing in code. Note that the lab name needs to be added per hand after manual check that this is consistent across all participants. Otherwise it might be advisable to fix numbering in the data. 

```{r}
# some labs consistently number from 1:18
labs_numbering_from_one <- c("lscppsl")

d$trial_num <- as.numeric(d$trial_num)

d <- d %>%
  mutate(trial_num = case_when(
    lab %in% labs_numbering_from_one &
      trial_type == "TRAIN" ~ trial_num - 3, # training = -2, -1
    lab %in% labs_numbering_from_one &
      trial_type != "TRAIN" ~ trial_num - 2, # test = 1:16
    TRUE ~ trial_num)) # otherwise


```

Test. 

```{r}
see_if(all(d$trial_num >= -2 & d$trial_num <= 16))
```

Second, if there aren't exactly 18 trials for a participant, we want to make it so there are! (IE by defining a row for an 'error' at trial 1, 2, etc. of each baby.) First, check how many rows exist for each participant (which may not be the same as the number of trials!)

These are cases where the number of trial numbers doesn't match the number of rows. 

```{r}
trial_row_checker <- d %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  summarize(trialcount = n_distinct(trial_num), 
            rowcount = length(trial_num)) 

trial_row_checker %>%
  filter(trialcount != rowcount) %>%
  datatable
```

This looks good so the next chunk does nothing right now (2019-01-23).

```{r}
# pull babies for which there is a miscount AND there are 18 rows
# note that cogdevlabbyu omitted many rows, so we can't correct any potential misnumbering
miscount_babies <- trial_row_checker %>%
  filter(trialcount != rowcount, rowcount == 18) %>% 
  unite("labsubid", c("lab","subid")) %>%
  pull(labsubid)

# note that this is a dangerous way to do this as it will fail silently if the trials are not ordered correctly, could be corrected down the line. 
d[paste(d$lab,d$subid, sep="_") %in% miscount_babies, "trial_num"] <- rep(c(-2,-1,1:16), 
                                                              length(miscount_babies))
```

These are case where there aren't 18 trials, perhaps because of failure to report missing trials. 

```{r}
trial_row_checker %>%
  filter(trialcount != 18) %>%
  datatable
```

Most of these cases are simply cases where labs haven't reported a bunch of `NA` trials for children who fussed out. We won't fix these. 

Test that we have matching numbering for all kids. 

```{r}
see_if(d %>%
         group_by(lab, subid) %>%
         summarize(trialcount = n_distinct(trial_num), 
                   rowcount = length(trial_num), 
                   match = trialcount == rowcount) %>%
         pull(match) %>%
         all)

```

** `trial_num` checking is satisfactory **


# Exclusion variables

* pilot
* monolingual
* developmental disorders
* second session
* preterm

and, perhaps most problematically:

* trial error
* participant error


## Pilot

Identifying participants as pilots. If `pilot == T` it indicates that there was the word "pilot" in their subid, session_error_type, or notes.

```{r}
d$pilot <- grepl("pilot", tolower(d$subid)) | 
  grepl("pilot", tolower(d$session_error_type)) | 
  grepl("pilot", tolower(d$notes))
```
  
## Bilingual
  
> Bilingual. Bilingual infants learning the community language plus another language were included in the bilingual sample.  Bilingual was defined by parent-report language input, with exposure to at least two languages 25-75% of the time from birth  (Byers-Heinlein, 2015).

```{r}
d$lang_group <- tolower(d$lang_group)

d %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  select(lang_group) %>%
  distinct %>%
  group_by(lang_group) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable

```

Determine who is bilingual based on the reported language exposures and compare to the group assignments (similar to the procedure in MB1).

```{r}
d$bilingual <- d$lang_group %in% 
  c("bilin", "bilingual", "bilingual")


d <- d %>%
  mutate(bilingual_exposure = case_when(
     lang1_exposure >= 25 & lang1_exposure <= 75 & lang2_exposure >= 25 & lang2_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     lang2_exposure >= 25 & lang2_exposure <= 75 & lang3_exposure >= 25 & lang3_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     lang3_exposure >= 25 & lang3_exposure <= 75 & lang4_exposure >= 25 & lang4_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     lang1_exposure >= 25 & lang1_exposure <= 75 & lang3_exposure >= 25 & lang3_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     lang1_exposure >= 25 & lang1_exposure <= 75 & lang4_exposure >= 25 & lang4_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     lang2_exposure >= 25 & lang2_exposure <= 75 & lang4_exposure >= 25 & lang4_exposure <= 75 ~ TRUE,
     TRUE ~ FALSE))

bilingual_mismatch <- d %>%
   filter(bilingual != bilingual_exposure) %>% 
  select(lab, subid, lang1_exposure, lang2_exposure, lang3_exposure, lang4_exposure, bilingual, bilingual_exposure) %>%
  unique()

multilingual <- bilingual_mismatch %>% 
  filter(lang1_exposure <90 & lang2_exposure < 90)

write_csv(multilingual, "metadata/multilingual.csv")
#returned 51 kids that are not bilinguals who met 25-75 % criteria, but 7 out of 51 were monolinguals, so 44 kids did not meet the 25-75% bilingual criteria
  
#count number of monolingual infants from the Mb1b dataset
mb1b_mono <- d %>% filter(lang1_exposure>=90|lang2_exposure>=90|lang3_exposure>=90|lang4_exposure>=90) 

mb1b_mono %>% summarize(n_distinct(subid)) 
#The number of mb1b_mono is too large (n=205), we suspect some labs reported data from mb1-analysis

#Extract the monolingual babies from mb1-analysis (only focus on the labs participating in mb1b)
MB1_mono <- read.csv(text=RCurl::getURI("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manybabies/mb1-analysis-public/master/processed_data/03_data_trial_main.csv"))

MB1_mono <- MB1_mono %>% filter(lab %in% mb1b_mono$lab) %>% 
                        mutate(subid = paste(lab, subid, sep = "_")) #%>%
                         #filter(lang1_exposure>=90|lang2_exposure>=90|lang3_exposure>=90|lang4_exposure>=90)

mb1b_mono_pure <- anti_join(mb1b_mono, MB1_mono,  by = "subid")

n_distinct(mb1b_mono_pure$subid) #we have only 33 additional monolingual babies!

write_csv(mb1b_mono_pure, "metadata/mb1b_mono.csv")
  
```


Using lab_community_language.csv to check whether infants in sample are learning community language as one of their language (must have at least 25% exposure). 
```{r}
lab_community_language <- read.csv("metadata/lab_community_language.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

d <- d %>%
  left_join(lab_community_language) %>%
  mutate(comm_lang_learn = case_when(
         lang1 == comm_lang & lang1_exposure >= 25 ~ TRUE,
         lang2 == comm_lang & lang2_exposure >= 25 ~ TRUE,
         lang3 == comm_lang & lang3_exposure >= 25 ~ TRUE,
         lang4 == comm_lang & lang4_exposure >= 25 ~ TRUE,
         TRUE ~ FALSE
         ))

#determine which babies are bilingual but not learning community language
not_community_language <- d %>%
  filter(!comm_lang_learn) %>%
  filter(bilingual_exposure) %>%
  select(lab, subid, lang1, lang2, lang3, lang4, lang1_exposure, lang2_exposure, lang3_exposure, lang4_exposure, bilingual, bilingual_exposure, age_days) %>%
  mutate(age_group=age_days/(365.25/12)) %>% 
  unique()

#note that 2 infants who did not learn community language were out of age groups in the bilingual dataset (i.e., not 6-9months or 12-15months)
```


In sum, `r sum(d$bilingual_exposure)` trials from `r length(unique(d[d$bilingual_exposure,]$subid))` children are classifed as bilingual based on reported percentages of language exposure, there is a mismatch of `r length(unique(bilingual_mismatch$subid))` participants, who were marked differently by experimenters compared to the exposure estimate. In most cases, this is due to a difference in cutoffs. Resolving this by incoproating correct info from bilingual_exposure into bilingual column. When there is a mismatch, going with bilingual_exposure classification. There are an additional `r length(not_community_language$subid)` who have bilingual exposure but are not learning the community language.



```{r}

d <- d %>% 
   mutate(bilingual = case_when(
     bilingual != bilingual_exposure ~ bilingual_exposure,
     bilingual == bilingual_exposure ~ bilingual,
     TRUE ~ NA)) # otherwise
```


Also check on monolingual status in this dataset, even though we will use the monolingual data from the MB1 dataset

```{r}

d <- d %>%
  mutate(monolingual_exposure = case_when(
    lang1_exposure >= 90 ~ TRUE,
    lang2_exposure >= 90 ~ TRUE,
    lang3_exposure >= 90 ~ TRUE,
    lang4_exposure >= 90 ~ TRUE,
    TRUE ~ FALSE
  ))

d %>% group_by(monolingual_exposure) %>% summarize(n_distinct(subid)) #205 monolinguals identified, correct
```


## cognitive_developmental
  
  > No diagnosed developmental disorders. We excluded infants with parent-reported developmental disorders (e.g., chromosomal abnormalities, etc.) or diagnosed hearing impairments. XYZ (%XYZ) infants were tested but did not meet this criterion. Due to concerns about the accuracy of parent reports, we did not plan exclusions based on self-reported ear infections unless parents reported medically-confirmed hearing loss. 


```{r}
unique(d$cognitive_developmental)

d$td <- !(tolower(d$cognitive_developmental) %in% 
                 c("yes","y"))

see_if(all(d$td %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

```

Some issues reported as having cognitive/developmental/hearing issues that don't seem to be grounds for exclusion. We are resolving this issue by reviewing lab notes for these participants and re-classifying them.

```{r}

participants_td_to_keep <- read_csv("metadata/participants_cog_hearing_exclusions.csv")

# elements not in participants_td_to_keep removed
participants_td_to_keep <- subset(participants_td_to_keep, participants_td_to_keep$lab %in% d$lab)

#validate lab names again
see_if(all(participants_td_to_keep$lab %in% d$lab))

d <- d %>% 
  left_join(participants_td_to_keep)

d$Exclude <- ifelse(is.na(d$Exclude),FALSE,d$Exclude)

d$td <- !(d$Exclude)

d <- select(d, -Exclude)

see_if(all(d$td %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

d %>% group_by(td) %>% summarise(length(unique(subid)))

```

We reviewed lab notes and re-classified infants as td based on these notes. See metadata-README.md regarding `participants_cog_hearing_exclusions.csv` for details about td classifications.
  
Currently, `r length(unique(d[!d$td,]$subid))` children are marked as not TD.

## second_session
  
```{r}
unique(d$second_session)

d$second_session <- tolower(d$second_session) %in% c("y")

see_if(all(d$second_session %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

d %>% group_by(second_session) %>% summarise(length(unique(subid)))

#there were no infants tested in the second session in mb1b
```

Currently `r signif(mean(d$second_session),2)*100`% of trials are marked as from second session babies and excluded from primary analyses. 

## fullterm and days_preterm

> Full-term. We defined full term as gestation times greater than or equal to 37 weeks.

```{r}
unique(d$preterm)

d$full_term <- !(tolower(d$preterm) %in% c("preterm", "y"))

see_if(all(d$full_term %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

```

Currently, `r sum(!d$full_term)` trials (`r signif(mean(!d$full_term),2)*100`%) from `r length(unique(d[!d$full_term,]$subid))` children are marked as preterm and excluded from primary analyses. 

Classifying infants by number of days preterm (prior to 37 weeks). First, correct for labs that reported days before 40 (and in one case 41) weeks, then classify infants less than 37 weeks as preterm.


```{r}
preterm_fix <- read_csv("metadata/preterm_fix.csv") %>%
  rename(lab = labid) %>%
  select(-filename)

#validate lab names
see_if(all(d$lab %in% preterm_fix$lab))

d <- d %>%
  left_join(preterm_fix)

d <- d %>%
  mutate(days_preterm_fixed = case_when(
    preterm_fix == "all_full_term" ~ NA_integer_,
    preterm_fix == "40" ~ as.integer(days_preterm - 21),
    preterm_fix == "41" ~ as.integer(days_preterm - 28),
    preterm_fix == "37" ~ as.integer(days_preterm),
    TRUE ~ as.integer(days_preterm)))

# remove unnecessary column
d <- select(d, -preterm_fix)

# classify infants as preterm based on days
# includes one fix for lab: ileap, subid: e48s006 who doesn't have anything in the `days_preterm` column but should be classified as preterm.
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(full_term_by_days = case_when(
    days_preterm_fixed <= 0 ~ TRUE,
    is.na(days_preterm_fixed) ~ TRUE,
    days_preterm_fixed > 0 ~ FALSE,
    TRUE ~ NA
  ))

# How many infants are classified as preterm by this method
table(d[!duplicated(d$subid),]$full_term_by_days)

preterm <- d %>% filter(full_term_by_days==FALSE) %>% select(lab, subid, lang1, lang2, lang3, lang4, lang1_exposure, lang2_exposure, lang3_exposure, lang4_exposure, bilingual, bilingual_exposure, age_days) %>% 
  mutate(age_group = age_days/(365.25/12)) %>% 
  unique()
#Note most of the pre-term infants are not bilinguals (not 25-75 criteria), only 4 pre-term bilingual infants were tested

```
Find mismatches with lab-reported status.

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  select(full_term, full_term_by_days) %>%
  distinct %>%
  filter(full_term != full_term_by_days) %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable()
```


Approaching preterm status this way, `r length(unique(d[!d$full_term_by_days,]$subid))` children (`r signif(mean(!d$full_term_by_days),2)*100`% of trials) are marked as preterm and excluded from primary analyses. Adopt `full_term_by_days` approach.
Temporarily assign status based on lab-determined column

```{r}

d$full_term <- d$full_term_by_days
d <- select(d,-full_term_by_days) 

#d <- d %>%
#  mutate(full_term = case_when(
#  preterm == "term" ~ TRUE,
#  preterm == "Term" ~ TRUE,
#  preterm == "N" ~ FALSE,
#  preterm == "Y" ~ FALSE,
#  is.na(preterm) ~ TRUE
#  ))
    
  

```

## session_error 

> Participants could also be excluded for analysis based on session-level errors, including: equipment error (e.g., no sound or visuals on the first pair of trials), experimenter error (e.g., an experimenter was unblinded in setups where infant looking was measured by live button press), or evidence of parent/outside interference noted by participating labs (e.g., talking or pointing by parents, construction noise, sibling pounding on door). XYZ (XYZ%) infants were dropped from analysis due to session-level errors (XYZ for equipment error, XYZ for experimenter error, XYZ for parental interference).

Note that some errors are trial-level and the trials will be dropped, others are participant-level and the participant will be dropped. 

```{r}
d$session_error <- tolower(d$session_error)
unique(d$session_error)
noerror_entries <- c("noerror", "noerro", NA, "no error")
```

Many participants may be marked as having a session error, despite having usable trials. Before excluding session error participants, we make sure we keep those participants we have identified as being incorrectly classified as a session error. This includes subjects marked as a session error by the lab for not completing all trials, for what we consider to be trial-level errors, or for not meeting a non-procedural criterion (excluded based on age, preterm, language, pilot testing, etc.). These subjects are in the metadata file `participants_session_error_keep.csv`. The column 'session_error_change_reason' also includes a short explanation of why we are reversing the session error code for each subject. In addition, we are adding a unified coding of the (remaining) session error types into three categories: equipment failure, outside interference, experimenter error. The recoded session error types are in the metadata file `participants_session_error_type.csv` and the column containing the updated session error code is named `session_error_type_recoded`.

```{r}
participants_error_to_keep <- read_csv("metadata/participants_session_error_keep.csv")

#validate lab names
see_if(all(participants_error_to_keep$lab %in% d$lab))

#validate subids
see_if(all(participants_error_to_keep$subid %in% d$subid))

d <- d %>% 
  left_join(participants_error_to_keep)

d$session_error_recoded <- ifelse(is.na(d$session_error_recoded),0,d$session_error_recoded)

d$session_error <- !(is.na(d$session_error)|
                       tolower(d$session_error) %in% noerror_entries | 
                         d$session_error_recoded == 1)

see_if(all(d$session_error %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

#add column for unified coding of session error
participants_error_type <- read_csv("metadata/participants_session_error_type.csv")

#validate lab names
see_if(all(!(is.na(participants_error_type$lab)) %in% d$lab))

d <- d %>% 
  left_join(participants_error_type)

d %>% group_by(session_error) %>% summarize(n=length(unique(subid)))

session_error_detail <- d %>% filter(session_error == TRUE) %>% 
  select(subid, session_error, session_error_type, session_error_type_recoded, notes) %>% 
  unique()
#39 infants were excluded here (note that some infants would be excluded because they were out of age range, not bilingual). Also, a number of infants were excluded because of experimental errors, such as failure to calibrate and parental interference.
```

## trial_error

Now move on to trial errors. 

```{r}
prop_error <- d %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  summarise(prop_error = mean(trial_error == "error")) 

prop_error %>%
  datatable
```

Note that there were a large number of trial numbers reported and there was no compliance at all in using our trial error categorization. 

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(trial_error_type) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(trial_error_type), 
         trial_error_type != "",
         trial_error_type != "NA",) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  datatable() 

```
Before excluding trial errors, we make sure we keep those trials we have identified as being incorrectly classified as a trial error and remove trials not marked as an error. These subjects are in the metadata file `participants_trial_error_keep.csv` (see metadata-README for details).

```{r}
participants_trial_error_update <- read_csv("metadata/participants_trial_error_update.csv")

#validate lab names
see_if(all(participants_trial_error_update$lab %in% d$lab))

d <- d %>% 
  left_join(participants_trial_error_update)

d$trial_error_new <- ifelse(is.na(d$trial_error_new),d$trial_error,d$trial_error_new)

d$trial_error_new <- tolower(d$trial_error_new)
unique(d$trial_error_new)
noerror_trial_entries <- c("noerror", "no error", "no", "no_error", "noerror'")

d$trial_error <- !(is.na(d$trial_error_new) |
                     d$trial_error_new %in% noerror_trial_entries)

d <- select(d, -trial_error_new)

see_if(all(d$trial_error %in% c(TRUE, FALSE)))

trial_error_detail <- d %>% filter(trial_error == TRUE) %>% 
  select (subid, trial_error, trial_error_type, trial_error_recoded, trial_error_type) %>% 
  unique()

```
There are `r sum(prop_error$prop_error == 1, na.rm=TRUE)` kids with 100% trial error (`r signif(mean(prop_error$prop_error == 1, na.rm=TRUE), 2)*100`%) out of a total of `r nrow(prop_error)` kids.


# Moderators

These variables are used in the main analyses as primary moderators. 

* NAE
* method
* gender
* age_days

## NAE

Create the NAE predictor for the primary preregistered data analyses. NAE marks participants from labs in north america. Here's the problem: language is "English" but is that NAE? 

Solution: hand-coding of labs, which should be checked. 

Changed from assuming that all babies from NAE labs are NAE-acquiring, which is not true. 

```{r}
NAE_labs <- read_csv("metadata/NAE_labs.csv")

#validate lab names
see_if(all(NAE_labs$lab %in% d$lab))

# elements not in preterm_fix removed
NAE_labs <- subset(NAE_labs, lab %in% d$lab)

#validate lab names
see_if(all(NAE_labs$lab %in% d$lab))

d <- nae_ind(d)

#d$nae <- d$lab %in% NAE_labs$lab
```


## Percent of NAE exposure


```{r}
#check unique languages 
sort(unique(c(d$lang1, d$lang2, d$lang3, d$lang4)))

nae_entries <- c("canadian english", "english", "english (canada)", "englsih")


d <- d %>%
  mutate(lang1, na_if(lang1, "na")) %>%
  mutate(lang2, na_if(lang2, "na")) %>%
  mutate(lang2, na_if(lang3, "na")) %>%
  mutate(lang4, na_if(lang4, "na"))

d <- d %>%
  mutate(nae_exp = case_when(
    nae == FALSE ~ as.numeric(0),
    nae == TRUE & lang1 %in% nae_entries ~ lang1_exposure, #if infant is classified as learning nae (via `nae_ind`) and lang1 is one of the possible `nae_entries` language nae_exp = lang1_exposure
    nae == TRUE & lang2 %in% nae_entries ~ lang2_exposure, #same as above for lang2
    nae == TRUE & lang3 %in% nae_entries ~ lang3_exposure, #same as above for lang3
    nae == TRUE & lang4 %in% nae_entries ~ lang4_exposure, #same as above for lang4
    TRUE ~ NA_real_))


```

##SES
```{r}

d <- d %>%
  mutate(parenta_gender = case_when(
    parenta_gender == "FALSE" ~ "F",
    TRUE ~ parenta_gender
  ))

sort(unique(d$parenta_gender))
sort(unique(d$parentb_gender))


d <- d %>% 
  mutate(SES=case_when(parenta_gender=="F"|parentb_gender=="M" ~ parenta_education,
                       parenta_gender=="M"|parentb_gender=="F" ~ parentb_education,
                       parenta_gender==NA|parentb_gender!=NA ~ parentb_education,
                       parenta_gender!=NA|parentb_gender==NA ~ parenta_education,
                       parenta_gender==parentb_gender ~ as.numeric((parenta_education+parentb_education)/2)))



```

## Method


```{r}
unique(d$method)

d$method <- tolower(str_replace_all(d$method, "-", "") %>%
                      str_replace_all(" ", ""))

d$method[d$method == "et"] <- "eyetracking"
d$method[d$method == "eyetracking&onlinecoding"] <- "eyetracking"
d$method[d$method == "headturn"] <- "hpp"
d$method[d$method == "preference"] <- "hpp"

unique(d$method)

see_if(all(d$method %in% c("hpp","eyetracking","singlescreen")))
```

## Gender


```{r}
unique(d$gender)
d$gender <- toupper(d$gender)

d <- d %>%
  mutate(gender2 = case_when(
    gender == "FEMALE" ~ "F", # change 'female' to F
    gender == "MALE" ~ "M", # change 'male' to M
    gender == "NA" ~ NA_character_, # change "NA" to NA
    gender == 0 ~ NA_character_, # change 0 to NA
    TRUE ~ gender))
    
d %>%
  group_by(lab, subid) %>%
  select(gender) %>%
  distinct %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  filter(!(gender %in% c("M","F"))) %>%
  count %>%
  datatable

see_if(all(d$gender %in% c("M", "F", NA)))

```


## age_days and age_group

Add age groups back in. 

```{r}
month <- 365.25 / 12

d$age_mo <- d$age_days / month
ggplot(d, aes(x = age_mo)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

d$age_group <- cut(d$age_mo, c(3,6,9,12,15), 
                   labels = c("3-6 mo","6-9 mo","9-12 mo","12-15 mo"), 
                   include.lowest = TRUE)
max(d$age_mo, na.rm=TRUE)

see_if(all(d$age_mo > 3 & d$age_mo < 15))
#the data do not pass this check - there are some infants >15mo old and some (N = 4) that have an NA for age_mo (looks like these are all participants that we don't have consents for and will need to be removed anyway).

d <- d %>%
  mutate(out_of_age = if_else(age_group %in% c("6-9 mo", "12-15 mo"), FALSE, TRUE))

summary(d$out_of_age)

participants_by_lab_and_age_group = d %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group) %>%
  summarize(participants = n_distinct(subid))

print(participants_by_lab_and_age_group, n=1e4)

participants_by_lab_and_age_group %>% filter(!age_group %in% c("6-9 mo", "12-15 mo")) %>% 
  pull(participants) %>% sum() # 164 participants were out-of-age!

```


# Dependent Variables

## looking_time

Looking times histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = looking_time)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_x_log10()
```

Some people reported in seconds, others in milliseconds. Identified a few labs who reported milliseconds rather than seconds. Converting their looking_time entries to seconds


```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  summarise(ms = mean(looking_time > 100, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(ms != 0) %>%
  datatable
  
## converting to seconds for labs confirmed as using milliseconds
labs_using_milliseconds <- read_csv("metadata/labs_convert_looking_time_to_seconds.csv")

d <- d %>% 
  mutate(looking_time = case_when(
    lab %in% labs_using_milliseconds$lab ~ looking_time/1000, # divide looking_time by 1000 
    TRUE ~ looking_time)) # otherwise
```

Also it is possible that some people used the old stimuli at 21s, while most others used the new 18s ones. Let's look at the distribution of labs with LTs > 18, > 19, and > 21s. 

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(lab) %>%
  summarise(more_than_18 = mean(looking_time > 18, na.rm=TRUE),
            more_than_19 = mean(looking_time > 19, na.rm = TRUE),
            more_than_21 = mean(looking_time > 21, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(more_than_18 != 0) %>%
  datatable

## per decision made on 10/19, cropping all looking times over 18s to exactly 18s

d <- d %>% 
   mutate(looking_time = ifelse(looking_time > 18, 18, # if looking_time > 18s, truncate it 18s
                               looking_time)) # otherwise, leaving looking_time

```

Re-examine visually. 

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = looking_time)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

Formal test. 

```{r}
see_if(all(d$looking_time <= 18, na.rm=TRUE))
```


## total_trial_time

We still have the milliseconds issue with `total_trial_time`. But as a prerequisite, `total_trial_time` should always be >= `looking_time`. Is this true? 

```{r}
d %>% 
  group_by(lab) %>%
  summarise(tt_greater_than_lt = mean(total_trial_time >= d$looking_time & !is.na(looking_time), na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tt_greater_than_lt)) %>%
  datatable()
```

The short answer is no. Many labs do not report `total_trial_time`, at least in a useable form. Those that do report it appear to be using it differently. 

This is **very worrisome** and may point to different intepretations of `looking_time` across labs. But for now the only thing we can do is disavow this variable and remove it from the dataset. 

```{r}
d <- select(d, -total_trial_time)
```
