# Intro

This script implements and documents exclusion criteria on the bilingual participants. Exclusion for monolingual participants is handled in the MB1 scripts. 



```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source(here::here("helper/common.R"))
source(here("helper/preprocessing_helper.R"))

```

# Exclusions

Note that all exclusions are written in paper format and sourced here so as to allow matching exactly to the data exclusion script. 

```{r child="paper/exclusions.Rmd"}

source_rmd("paper/exclusions.Rmd")
```


Also short looking times need to be removed here (and in the manuscript, identically). 

```{r}
d$short_lt <- d$looking_time < 2

short_lt <- exclude_by(d, quo(short_lt), action = "NA out", 
                   return_pcts = TRUE, 
                   quiet = TRUE)
d <- short_lt$data
```

# Trial pairing (blinding, differences)

Remove all training trials. There are a number of cases where there are missing stimulus numbers and trial types. This is problematic and needs to be checked. 

```{r}
d %>%
  filter(trial_type != "TRAIN") %>%
  group_by(lab, subid, stimulus_num) %>%
  count %>%
  filter(n > 2) %>%
  datatable
```

Make sure that our trial pairs are not duplicated once we have removed these missing data and the training trials.  

```{r}
d <- filter(d, trial_type != "TRAIN", 
            !is.na(trial_type)) 

trial_pairs <- d %>%
  group_by(lab, subid, stimulus_num) %>%
  count 

see_if(all(trial_pairs$n <= 2), 
            msg = "DUPLICATED TRIAL PAIRS")
```


## Blinding 

Current data output is **UNBLINDED.** 

```{r}
# d <- d %>%
#   group_by(lab, subid, stimulus_num) %>%
#   mutate(trial_type = base::sample(trial_type))
```


```{r}
write_csv(d, "processed_data/03_bilingual_dataset_cleaned.csv")
```
