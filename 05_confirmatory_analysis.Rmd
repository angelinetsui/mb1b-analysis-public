# Intro

This RMarkdown file reports analyses of the primary ManyBabies 1B (IDS Preference) dataset. It relies on data cached in `04_merge_with_monolinguals.Rmd`.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("helper/common.R")
export_figs <- FALSE
library(lmerTest)
library(car)
library(performance)
#library(renv)
```

Load a renv.lock file
```{r}
# renv::update("lme4")
# renv::snapshot()
# renv::activate()
```


Read in intermediate, cached datafiles. Select columns for analysis.

```{r}
# Read in datasets, select analysis columns, relevel lang_group to make monolinguals base level

#If column types aren't specified, read_csv makes guesses about them based on the first 1000 rows of data. Below, data are read in with column types specified for columns that will be used in this .Rmd file. `col_only` in the code means that all columns that aren't specified will be dropped. (see issue #66 for more info) For now, all columns are read in as  a double (using shortcut "d"), logical ("l"), or character ("c"). 

# per previous code, d_matched and d_full are read in with the following columns: "trial_num", "lab", "subid", "trial_type", "stimulus_num", "looking_time", "missing", "method", "age_group", "age_mo", "age_days", "lang_group", "nae", "nae_exp", "SES", "gender"

# Matched Dataset Descriptives

Plot of participants across age.

```{r}
participants <- d_matched %>%
  group_by(lab, subid, lang_group) %>%
  summarise(age_days = age_days[1]) 

ggplot(participants, 
       aes(x = age_days/(365.25/12), fill = lab)) +

  xlab("Age (months)") + 
  xlim(3, 16) +

```

Total babies in matched samples: `r d_matched %>% group_by(lab, subid) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% nrow()`.
Total babies in unmatched samples: `r d_full %>% group_by(lab, subid) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% nrow()`.

## Looking Time

```{r}
ggplot(filter(d_matched, looking_time < 20, 
              trial_num > 0), 
       aes(x = trial_num, y = looking_time, color = lang_group)) +

```
  
  
```{r}
d_matched %>%
  #filter(trial_type != "train") %>% all training trials were removed in the exclusions file
  group_by(age_group, lang_group, trial_num) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(looking_time, na.rm=TRUE), 
            n = n(), 
            sd = sd(looking_time, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = trial_num, y = mean, col = lang_group, lty = age_group)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Trial Number") + 
  ylab("Mean Looking Time (s)") + 
  ylim(0,12)
```


# Results

## Child outcomes

Are children making it through the experiment? We see that many kids are habituating and are not making it throughout the study.
<!-- need to create the variable "missing" for bilingual infants. Work on this later -->
```{r}
# d_matched %>%
#   group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group, subid) %>%
#   summarize(max_trial = max(trial_num[!missing])) %>%
#   summarise(prop_finishing = signif(mean(max_trial == 16, na.rm=TRUE), digits=2)) %>%
#   arrange(age_group, prop_finishing) %>%
#   DT::datatable()
```

Now, histogram of looking time by trial number. Looking times are declining across trials. Further, this graph understates this effect somewhat because missing data are not shown. 

```{r}
ms <- d_matched %>%
  group_by(trial_num, lang_group) %>%
  summarise(looking_time = mean(looking_time, na.rm=TRUE))

p <- ggplot(d_matched, aes(x = looking_time, 
                   fill = age_group)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  geom_vline(data = ms, aes(xintercept = looking_time), lty = 2) + 
  facet_wrap(.~trial_num) + 
  xlim(c(0,20)) + 
  xlab("Looking time (s)") + 
  ylab("Trials") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  scale_fill_solarized(name = "Age group")

if (export_figs) {
  pdf("figure_exports/looking_time.pdf",width = 6, height = 4)
  print(p)
  dev.off()
} else {
  p
}
```

# IDS-ADS condition differences

We will be pursuing a within-subjects analysis approach, so almost all of our analysis will happen over pairs of trials. The downside of this approach is that if you are missing data from one of the trials in a pair, you are missing the difference score for that pair.  

## Distribution of the matched dataset

What's the distributional form of these difference score data? 

```{r}
qplot(diff, binwidth = 1,
      data = filter(d_diffs_matched, !is.na(diff))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(d_diffs_matched$diff, na.rm=TRUE), col = "red", lty = 2)
```

Interestingly, this distribution is not skewed, but it does have very overdispersed shape with a big strong peak in the middle and then long tails. Also, the mean is `r round(mean(d_diffs_matched$diff, na.rm=TRUE), digits = 2)`s, which indicates an overall preference for IDS.  

IDS-ADS difference patterns
How does the IDS-ADS difference change with trials?

```{r}
ms_diff_matched <- d_diffs_matched %>%
  group_by(age_group, lang_group, trial_num) %>%
  multi_boot_standard(col = "diff", na.rm = TRUE)

p <- ggplot(ms_diff_matched, aes(x = trial_num, y = mean, col = age_group, lty = lang_group)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper),
                  position = position_dodge(width= .1)) +
  ylab("IDS preference (s)") +
  xlab("Trial Pair Number") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_solarized(name = "Age group")

if (export_figs) {
  pdf("figure_exports/looking_time_diffs.pdf",width = 5, height = 4)
  print(p)
  dev.off()
} else {
  p
}
```
 
# Meta-analytic approach

Following suggestions by Alex Cristia, who argued that this is a more straightforward approach and also has been followed in ManyLabs and the RRRs previously. In addition, it doesn't require knowing the full form of the required mixed-effects model (e.g., trial order effects, age x trial order interactions, quadratic habituation, etc.).
 
Compute effect size for each lab. This analysis follows the recommendation in [Jake Westfall's blogpost](http://jakewestfall.org/blog/index.php/2016/03/25/five-different-cohens-d-statistics-for-within-subject-designs/), which says that "classic" Cohen's $d$ is the difference of the means divided by the pooled standard deviation across conditions. We  compute $d_z$, the more standard within-subjects analysis, which we expect is more like what we recover from the previous meta-analytic work.
 
We will be using $d_z$ (trial_wise) in the final meta-analysis. 
 
 **POST PRE-REG DECISION: EXCLUDE LABS WITH FEWER THAN N=10 IN AGE BIN FROM MA**
 
 From the prereg:
 > "We included data from a lab in our analysis if they were able to achieve the minimum N required for a half-sample in their age bin (N=16) by the end date of testing and if, after exclusions, they contributed more than 10 data points (XYZ labs registered but were not included in the final sample because of this criterion)."

 We didn't expect that so many labs would run "out of age" babies and so this is changing the MA considerably. Accordingly, we interpret the above as excluding cells with N < 10 from the MA (but not the LMER analyses). 
 
 Note that at least one row is being filtered due to NA ES estimates.

`##Calculate the effect size for each pair of LT difference between IDS and ADS
### Matched dataset
```{r}
source("helper/ma_helper.R")

ages <- d_matched %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group, subid) %>%
  summarise(age_mo = mean(age_mo)) %>%
  summarise(age_mo = mean(age_mo)) %>% 
  mutate(age_mo_centered = scale(age_mo, scale = FALSE))

ds_zt_matched_set <- d_diffs_matched %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group, subid) %>%
  summarise(d = mean(diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_d = mean(d, na.rm=TRUE),
            d_z = mean(d, na.rm = TRUE) / sd(d, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = length(unique(subid)),
            d_z_var = d_var_calc(n, d_z)) %>%
  filter(n >= 10) %>%
  left_join(ages) %>%
  filter(!is.na(d_z)) # CHECK THIS

#note that there are NaN values in the ln_mean_d, replace them with zero?
```

### Unmatched dataset

```{r}
ages <- d_full %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group, subid) %>%
  summarise(age_mo = mean(age_mo)) %>%
  summarise(age_mo = mean(age_mo)) %>% 
  mutate(age_mo_centered = scale(age_mo, scale = FALSE))

ds_zt_unmatched_set <- d_diffs_full %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group, subid) %>%
  summarise(d = mean(diff, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(lab, age_group, lang_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_d=mean(d,na.rm=TRUE),
            d_z = mean(d, na.rm = TRUE) / sd(d, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = length(unique(subid)),
            d_z_var = d_var_calc(n, d_z)) %>%
  filter(n >= 10) %>%
  left_join(ages) %>%
  filter(!is.na(d_z)) # CHECK THIS
```

## Effect size-based meta-analysis

First, interecept-only model: examine the mean effect size across all groups in MB1B, regardless of language backgrounds.

### The average IDS effect size in the Matched dataset

```{r}
intercept_matched_set <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ 1, vi = d_z_var, slab = lab, data = 
                                        ds_zt_matched_set, method = "REML")
summary(intercept_matched_set)
```

### The average IDS effect size in the Unmatched dataset

```{r}
intercept_unmatched_set <- metafor::rma(d_z ~1, vi = d_z_var, slab = lab, data = ds_zt_unmatched_set, method = "REML")
summary(intercept_unmatched_set)
```

Note that in both matched and unmatched models, Q statistics indicate that there is non-significant heterogenenity. Here, we report the unmatched model. Any numbers in $I^2$ = `r intercept_unmatched_set$I2` is essentially meaningless. Reason for I not being zero when Q statistics is non-significant is as follow: $I^2 = (Q - df) / Q$ (following [Higgins et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC192859/)). When Q drops below df, as it does here (Q = `r intercept_unmatched_set$Q` and df = `r nrow(ds_zt_unmatched_set) -1`), then $I^2$ is defined as being zero, e.g. no heterogeneity. 

## Language*age moderation (pre-reg)

### Matched dataset

```{r}
lang_mod_matched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ age_mo_centered*lang_group, vi = d_z_var,
                    slab = lab, data = ds_zt_matched_set, method = "REML")
summary(lang_mod_matched)
```
The lang_only_matched model has suggested that there is no significant difference in IDS preference between monolinguals and bilinguals
```{r}
lang_only_matched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ lang_group, vi = d_z_var,
                    slab = lab, data = ds_zt_matched_set, method = "REML")
summary(lang_only_matched)
```
But as indicated in the RR analysis plan, we will report the average effect size for each language group
```{r}
#monolinguals' IDS ES in the matched dataset
mono_sample_matched <- ds_zt_matched_set %>% filter(lang_group == "monolingual") 

mono_only_matched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ 1, vi = d_z_var, data = mono_sample_matched, slab = lab, method = "REML")
summary(mono_only_matched)

#bilinguals' IDS ES in the matched dataset
bil_sample_matched <- ds_zt_matched_set %>% filter(lang_group == "bilingual") 

bil_only_matched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ 1, vi = d_z_var, data = bil_sample_matched, slab = lab, method = "REML")
summary(bil_only_matched)
```


### Unmatched dataset

```{r}
lang_mod_unmatched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ age_mo_centered*lang_group, vi = d_z_var,
                    slab = lab, data = ds_zt_unmatched_set, method = "REML")
summary(lang_mod_unmatched)
```
Neither age nor language group (plus their interaction term) is significant

We will report the average effect size for each language group
```{r}
#monolinguals' IDS ES in the unmatched dataset
mono_sample_unmatched <- ds_zt_unmatched_set %>% filter(lang_group == "monolingual") 

mono_only_unmatched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ 1, vi = d_z_var, data = mono_sample_unmatched, slab = lab, method = "REML")
summary(mono_only_unmatched)

#bilinguals' IDS ES in the unmatched dataset 
bil_sample_unmatched <- ds_zt_unmatched_set %>% filter(lang_group == "bilingual") 

bil_only_unmatched <- metafor::rma(d_z ~ 1, vi = d_z_var, data = bil_sample_unmatched, slab = lab, method = "REML")
summary(bil_only_unmatched)
```

We began by removing random slopes nested within items (as that grouping was of least theoretical interest) and next removing random slopes nested within subjects and then labs. We then removed random intercepts from groupings in the same order. We were able to retain random effects of trial number nested within subjects. All other random effects (e.g., trial_type) led to singularity fit and thus were pruned from the model.

#I have controlled for lang_group on the lab level as it is stated in the pre-registered ms that bilingualism is a more important theortical IV for random slope. However, it is important to note that we can only control lang_group as random slope at lab level here. We cannot include more slopes as the model will not converge or report singularity (AT).

Note that this analysis only includes bilingual infants as indicated in the pre-registered ms (AT).
As we are only examining bilingual infants in LMM2, there is no difference between matched and unmatched dataset (as no lab that collected bilingual infants have n<10 when combining two age groups together, see my notes in the session "Create matached dataset for the Looking time")
I used matched dataset here because it contains all bilingual labs here.
